# [react-lighthouse-viewer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lighthouse-viewer)

If you have generated lighthouse report using lighthouse CLI, you can use this component to render the JSON report inside React.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add react-lighthouse-viewer
```

## Usage

```Javascript
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import ReportViewer from 'react-lighthouse-viewer';

import jsonReport from './report.json';

const App = () => (
    <ReportViewer json={jsonReport} />
);
render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

## To generate lighthouse reports, use CLI

### Install lighthouse globally

```sh
npm install -g lighthouse
```

**Run CLI**: `lighthouse https://blencorp.com --output=json --output-path=./report.json`

By default, Lighthouse writes the report to an HTML file. You can control the output format by passing flags.

### CLI options

```sh
$ lighthouse --help
